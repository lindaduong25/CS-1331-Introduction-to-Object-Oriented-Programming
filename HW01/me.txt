Hello, my name is Linda Duong and I am a Computer Science major planning to study the Media/People threads.
I am a first year student at GT, although classified as a Junior due to dual enrollment and AP credits from high school. 
As for a personal interest, I like to play video games, but it has been quite a while since I last turned on my console. 
My recitation session is CS 1331R-O1R from 5:00 pm to 6:15 pm.
I am living at home with my parents and taking classes remotely. I hope to be able to live on campus starting in the fall of 2021.
